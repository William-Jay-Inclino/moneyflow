# Shared State Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
- ExpenseScreen and AllExpensesScreen were not sharing state, causing updates in one screen to not reflect in the other.

## Solution Implemented
Both screens now use the shared **expenseStore** created with Zustand.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ExpenseScreen.tsx
✅ **Already Updated** (from previous work)
- Uses `useExpenseStore()` for all expense and category data
- Uses store methods: `addExpense()`, `updateExpense()`, `deleteExpense()`, `loadExpenses()`, `loadCategories()`
- Uses computed values: `getTotalExpenses()`, `getRecentExpenses()`, `getCategoryIcon()`
- Removed all local state for expenses and categories
- Removed direct API calls

### 2. AllExpensesScreen.tsx  
✅ **Just Fixed**
- Uses `useExpenseStore()` for all expense and category data
- Uses store methods: `addExpense()`, `updateExpense()`, `deleteExpense()`, `loadExpenses()`, `loadCategories()`
- Uses computed values: `getCategoryIcon()` from store
- Removed all local state for expenses and categories (`expenseList`, `setExpenseList`)
- Removed direct API calls in `handleUpdateExpense`
- Fixed date management to use `localCurrentDate` consistently
- Uses `expenses` directly from store instead of local `expenseList`

### 3. Shared expenseStore.ts
✅ **Already Created**
- Global state management for expenses and categories
- Centralized API calls and state updates
- Computed getters for commonly used data
- Automatic state synchronization across all components

## How Shared State Works Now

1. **Data Loading**: Both screens call `loadExpenses()` and `loadCategories()` from the store
2. **Adding Expenses**: Both screens use `addExpense()` which updates the global state
3. **Updating Expenses**: Both screens use `updateExpense()` which updates the global state
4. **Deleting Expenses**: Both screens use `deleteExpense()` which updates the global state
5. **Real-time Updates**: Any change in one screen immediately reflects in the other screen

## Verification
When you update an expense in AllExpensesScreen, it will now immediately appear updated in ExpenseScreen because they share the same global state.

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/src/screens/main/AllExpensesScreen.tsx` - Fixed to use shared store
- ✅ `/src/screens/main/ExpenseScreen.tsx` - Already using shared store  
- ✅ `/src/store/expenseStore.ts` - Shared state store
- ✅ `/src/store/index.ts` - Exports expense store
